It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and uses in-memory storage.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete student records
- Input validation using Pydantic
- Thread-safe in-memory storage
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)
- Easy local setup

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SekharSunkara/https://github.com/SekharSunkara6/FealtyX-Assignment.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. (Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The server will start at:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

You can use these pages to interact with and test all API endpoints.

## Example Requests

**Create a student (POST /students):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 21,
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

**Update a student (PUT /students/1):**
```json

- Use `/docs` for interactive testing.
- If you see a message like `{ "message": "Student API is running!" }` at the root URL, your API is running correctly.
